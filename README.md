# Mission-to-Mars
   Module 10

The purpose of this challenge is to obtain information from an existing web page and create a page where the changes are updated to achieve this, BeautifulSoup and Splinter must be used to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

Initially, a code is provided from which, by carrying out some command lines, a new web page with the requested information will be obtained, as shown in the following image.


The initial files were:
Index.html
Mission_to_Mars_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb

The work done in programming the command lines in the different initial files was challenging. It takes dedication and trial and error setup to achieve the goal of reaching the image above.

The result obtained was saved in a database called Mongo, which is the ideal one for this type of information updating management. 

The following image shows us how the information stored in the database is.
